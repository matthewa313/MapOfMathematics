\begin{proof}
    We seek to identify the matrix $A$ such that $A[v]_\mathfrak{B} = [v]_\mathfrak{B}$ by means of the Key Theorem. In particular, $$Ae_i = AL_\mathfrak{B}(b_i) = L_\mathfrak{A}(b_i).$$ Thus the $i$th column of $A$ is $L_\mathfrak{A}(b_i),$ which is also the $i$th column of the change of basis matrix from $\mathfrak{A}$ to $\mathfrak{B}.$ Thus, $A=\cobmatrix{B}{A}$ so $\cobmatrix{A}{B}[v]_\mathfrak{B} = [v]_\mathfrak{B}.$
\end{proof}
