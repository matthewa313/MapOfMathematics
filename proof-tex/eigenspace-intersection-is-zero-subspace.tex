\begin{proof}
    Suppose we have two distinct $E_\lambda$ and $E_{\lambda'}$ with eigenvectors $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ respectively. And suppose $v\in E_{\lambda} \cap E_{\lambda'},$ so $v\in E_{\lambda}$ and $v\in E_{\lambda'}.$ Then $T(v)=\lambda v=\lambda'v,$ so $(\lambda' - \lambda)v=0,$ which holds precisley when $v=0$ (as $\lambda\neq\lambda'.$) Thus $E_{\lambda} \cap E_{\lambda'} = \{0\}.$
\end{proof}
