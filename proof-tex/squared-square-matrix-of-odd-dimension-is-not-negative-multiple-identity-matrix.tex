\begin{proof}
    Suppose for contradiction that there exists some $M\in\reals^{2\times 2}$ such that $M^2=kI_n.$
    Then $\det M^2=\det(kI_n)=k^n\det I_n=k^n$ (by either the homogeneity of the determinant or the fact that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements).
    Since $k$ is odd, $k^n<0.$
    Further the multiplicative property of determinants, $\det M^2 = (\det M)^2,$ which we know to be greater than zero as the square of a nonnegative number is nonnegative.
    Thus we have encountered a contradiction, namely that $\det M^2 < 0$ and $\det M^2 \geq 0.$
    Therefore, there does not exist any $M\in\reals^{2\times 2}$ such that $M^2=kI_n$ for odd $n$ and negative $k.$
\end{proof}
