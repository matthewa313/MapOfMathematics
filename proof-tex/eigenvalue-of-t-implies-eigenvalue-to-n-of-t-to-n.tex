\begin{proof}
    Suppose $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue for $T.$ Then for some vector $v\in V,$ $T(v)=\lambda v.$ Therefore, and by applying the linearity of $T,$
    $$T^n(v) = T^{n-1}(\lambda v) = \lambda T^{n-1}(v) = \lambda T^{n-2}(\lambda v) = \cdots = \lambda^{n-1} T(v) = \lambda^n v.$$ This says that $\lambda^n$ is an eigenvalue of $T^n.$
\end{proof}
