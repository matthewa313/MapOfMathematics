\begin{proof}
    Write $\mathfrak{B}_k = \{v_{k1},v_{k2},\ldots,v_{kn_k}\}.$ Then consider the relation $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{r} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_k} c_{kj}v_{kj} = 0.$$ Now let $$w_k = \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n_k} c_{kj}v_{kj}.$$ Observe that $w,$ as a linear combination of the vectors in $\mathfrak{B}_k,$ is an eigenvector with the eigenvalue $\lambda_k.$ Returning to our relation with $w$ we have, $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{r} w_k = 0.$$ Note that eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent, so there is no nontrivial relation on the set $\{w_1,\ldots,w_r\}.$ Therefore, $w_1=\ldots=w_r=0.$ Now, because $\mathfrak{B}_k$ is linearly independent, and $c_{kj}=0$ for all $k,j.$ Therefore the relation is trivial, and the theorem follows.
